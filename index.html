        <hr>
        <h4>Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School.</h4>
        <h4>In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</h4>
